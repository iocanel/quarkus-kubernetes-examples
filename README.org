* Quarkus Kubernetes Examples


  The matrix below shows all possbile combinations between `platforms` and `container image technologies`.

  **Note**: The matrix above uses a different column for Openshift and OKD to distinguish between upstream and product, so that its more clear on what is supported and what not.
  The rest of this document and the examples just use `Openshift` for both (as there are no techincal differences).
